## Documentation

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm writing the documentation!

## Introduction

CerealKit is based on Tingle, a minimalist and easy-to-use modal plugin
written in pure JavaScript:

* No dependencies required
* Fully customizable via CSS
* CSS transitions
* Simple API
* No extra files to download
* Created with UX in mind

It allows you to embed your own cereals!
